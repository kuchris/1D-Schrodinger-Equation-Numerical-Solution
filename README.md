# 1D-Schrodinger-Equation-Numerical-Solution

The goal of this project is to solve 1D time independent Schrodinger equations using the numerical
method. The tri-diagonals method is used to find out the eigenvalues and eigenvectors from
the bounded Schrodinger equation for an arbitrary potential energy function. For each case, the
potential function, eigenvector and eigenvalue will be drawn. The main language of the code will
be written using Python3.
